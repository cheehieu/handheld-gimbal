## Overview
Point-of-view (POV) video footage can be disorienting, especially if the camera is mounted statically. With the increasing popularity of small action cameras, such as GoPro, more people are capturing POV footage using head-, chest-, and handheld mounts.

There are several products currently on the market, which can greatly improve the stability of a shot. However, most of the good solutions come with a hefty price tag, approaching the cost of the camera itself! This project explores the cost of fabricating a 3-axis gimbal prototype for a handheld GoPro camera. It details the design and manufacturing process by using a 3D printer, CNC, and injection molder to integrate brushless motors, gyroscope, accelerometer, gimbal controller, and LiPo battery power distribution system. Design choices are made to build the best-value solution.
